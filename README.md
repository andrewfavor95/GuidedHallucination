# GuidedHallucination

This repository provides a collection of custom loss functions and tools for use with the [ColabDesign repository](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabDesign). 

The purpose of these loss functions is to guide the structure of hallucinated proteins towards exhibiting desired features and properties.  

This repository currently consists of [hallucination demos](https://github.com/andrewfavor95/GuidedHallucination/tree/main/demos) to show the effect of various loss functions, and also a set of [modules](https://github.com/andrewfavor95/GuidedHallucination/tree/main/demos), for conveniently importing these tools into your own code.

This repository is under active development; please contact afavor@uw.edu for any questions or suggestions.

## Current and coming functions:
* Secondary structure specification loss (done)
* Cyclic symmetry loss (done)
* Domain contact loss (done)
* Aspect ratio loss (done)
* Blueprint builder emulation (in progress)
* Hallucination from procedurally generated distance matrices (in progress)
